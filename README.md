# SQL Commands Practice Repository

## Overview

This repository contains Python code examples for practicing various SQL commands and queries. The objective is to explore and try out different SQL queries that can be implemented in a SQL database, such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, LIKE, ORDER BY, and NOT NULL, as well as commands to join different tables, like INNER JOIN.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

1. `SQL_Queries.py`: This Python script contains examples of SQL commands and queries implemented using Python code. Each query is accompanied by comments explaining its purpose and usage.

2. `data/`: This directory contains sample datasets used for practicing SQL queries. These datasets are in CSV format and can be easily loaded into a SQL database for experimentation.

## SQL Commands Covered

The Python code examples cover the following SQL commands and queries:

- SELECT: Retrieve data from one or more tables.
- FROM: Specify the table(s) from which to retrieve data.
- WHERE: Filter rows based on specified conditions.
- LIKE: Filter rows based on a specified pattern.
- ORDER BY: Sort the result set based on specified columns.
- NOT NULL: Filter rows where a column has a non-null value.
- JOIN: Combine data from multiple tables using different types of joins (e.g., INNER JOIN).
